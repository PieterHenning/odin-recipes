        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>¼ tsp ground turmeric</li>
        <li>250ml (1 cup) full cream milk</li>
        <li>5 bay leaves on the stem</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 180°C. </li>
        <li>Soak the bread in milk and set aside.</li>
        <li>Melt the butter in a large, deep ovenproof frying pan over medium heat (see note). Add the onion and cook, stirring, for 3-4 minutes or until soft. Season with salt and pepper. Add the garlic, ginger, curry powder and curry leaves and stir for 1 minute or until fragrant. Add the tomato paste, chutney, curry leaves and vinegar and cook for 2-3 minutes to caramelize the mixture slightly. Add the mince and cook, breaking up any lumps with a wooden spoon, for 5-6 minutes or until browned. Stir in the soaked bread and milk, breaking it up to combine, then add the sultanas and almonds.</li>
        <li>Add 250 ml (1 cup) water and check the seasoning. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook for 10 minutes or until thickened and reduced.   </li>
        <li>For the topping, beat the eggs, turmeric and milk in a bowl or jug and season with salt. Remove the beef mixture from the heat, then press down on the mixture to create a flat surface. Carefully pour over the egg mixture and scatter with the bay leaves. Bake for 35-40 minutes or until the topping is golden.</li>
        <li>Remove the bobotie from the oven and serve immediately, with the rice, salad and extra chutney.</li>
